2. Platform-independent: Java is designed to be platform-independent, which means it can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This is why you can write a Java program on your desktop computer and then run it on your mobile phone, as long as both have a JVM.

3. Safe: Java is a safe language, which means it provides features to avoid common programming pitfalls, such as null pointer exceptions and buffer overflows.

4. Collections: Java has a rich set of collections, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and TreeSet, which makes it easier to manage data.

5. I/O: Java provides various classes for handling input/output operations, such as BufferedReader, FileReader, and PrintWriter.

6. Networking: Java provides various classes for networking, such as Socket, ServerSocket, and DatagramSocket, which makes it easier to develop network applications.

7. XML: Java has built-in support for processing XML documents, thanks to the javax.xml.parsers package.

8. Web: Java is a key technology behind the development of the World Wide Web, as it was created to run on the Java platform. Many web applications are built using Java technologies, such as JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet.

9. Mobile: Android, the popular operating system for mobile devices, is built using Java.

10. Scripting: Java supports scripting through the Java Script API, which allows embedding JavaScript code within Java applications.

In summary, Java is a powerful, versatile, and widely-used programming language that can be used to build various types of applications, from web applications to mobile applications and enterprise applications."
16,What is JavaScript?,"

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language which is used for various purposes such as web development, mobile applications development, server-side programming, and electronic gaming.
