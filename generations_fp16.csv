15,What is Java?,"

Java is a popular, object-oriented programming language that was first introduced by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) in 1995.

It is used for developing various types of applications, such as web applications, mobile applications (Android apps), enterprise applications, and more. Java is designed to be platform-independent, which means that code written on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on one operating system can run on a JVM on another operating system.

The Java language is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes the Java compiler (javac), the Java runtime (java), and other tools for developing and deploying Java applications.

Here's a simple example of Java code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(""Hello, World!"");
    }
}
```

This code defines a class named `HelloWorld` with a `main` method, which is the entry point of a Java application. The `System.out.println` statement prints ""Hello, World!"" to the console."
16,What is JavaScript?,"

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language which is used for various purposes such as web development, mobile applications development, server-side scripting, and automation.

In web development, JavaScript is used to create interactive elements on a webpage such as hover effects, animations, and dynamic content loading. It can also be used to validate user inputs, handle user interactions, and communicate with server APIs.

In mobile applications development, JavaScript is used to create native mobile apps that can run on iOS and Android platforms. It can also be used to develop cross-platform mobile apps using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.

In server-side scripting, JavaScript is often used in conjunction with Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server-side. This enables developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming, which can be beneficial for tasks such as handling API requests, validating user inputs, and managing server-side state.

In automation, JavaScript can be used to create scripts that automate repetitive tasks or perform complex operations on data. This is often used in testing and QA environments to streamline the testing process and ensure the reliability of software applications.

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used in various contexts and for a wide range of purposes. Its popularity and wide range of available resources make it a popular choice for developers of all skill levels."
17,What is Perl?,"
Perl is a popular, high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web-based applications, such as CGI scripts, web crawlers, and web administrators.

18,What is OpenCV?,"

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular computer vision library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms implemented in C++, Python, and Java.

It is used for various purposes such as object detection and recognition, image filtering, feature extraction, and machine learning. OpenCV is widely used in robotics, surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and many other applications due to its versatility and high performance.

The project's goal is to create a platform for collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the computer vision community. The library is released under the Apache 2.0 License, which allows users to use, modify, and distribute the library and its dependencies freely.

Here's a simple example of using OpenCV in Python for image filtering:

```python
import cv2

# Load an image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply a Gaussian blur to the grayscale image
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)

# Save the blurred image
cv2.imwrite('blurred_image.jpg', blurred)
```

In this example, we first load an image and convert it to grayscale. Then, we apply a Gaussian blur to the grayscale image using the `cv2.GaussianBlur()` function. Finally, we save the blurred image."
